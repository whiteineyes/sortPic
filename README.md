# sortPic
picking out the pictures from Google takeout photos folder based on py3

I have downloaded the google photos with takeout tool, but the photos are sorted in folder due date

It`s painful to pick every photo out from every folder, so I made this to save my time

this program is based on python3, u can modify it into py2 or whatever

enjoy!
